The IN operator is a good early demonstrator of the elegance of the relational model. 
The argument it takes is not just a list of values - it's actually a table with a single column. 
Since queries also return tables, if you create a query that returns a single column, you can 
feed those results into an IN operator. 
To give a toy example:

select * 
	from cd.facilities
	where
		facid in (
			select facid from cd.facilities
			);

This example is functionally equivalent to just selecting all the facilities, 
but shows you how to feed the results of one query into another. The inner query is called a subquery.


USING case
select name, 
	case when (monthlymaintenance > 100) then 'expensive'
	else 'cheap'
	end as cost
	from cd.facilities;

Note: To add a 'middling' option, we would simply insert another when...then section.

DATE TIME FORMAT:
This is our first look at SQL timestamps. 
They're formatted in descending order of magnitude: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.nnnnnn. 
We can compare them just like we might a unix timestamp, although getting the 
differences between dates is a little more involved (and powerful!). 
In this case, we've just specified the date portion of the timestamp. 
This gets automatically cast by postgres into the full timestamp 2012-09-01 00:00:00.
